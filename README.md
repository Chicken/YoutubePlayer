# YoutubePlayer

Random sideproject.

Youtube client to play music with spotify like interface I guess...

Made with Node.JS and electron.

Will probably never be finished... pull requests appreciated

## Some known issues

1. Skipping ahead in video can bug back to current position
2. Search is slow
3. Loading a video is slow
4. Stuck or crash if video length is long

Slowness of music loading can be explained by the fact that the whole video is downloaded to memory instead of playing it directly. Help me. I don't know any better. Do a pull request and remove this message on it if you fix this.
